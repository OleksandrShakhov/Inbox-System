# Inbox-System
This is the fullstack project with the creation of a basic inbox system.
Here you can find the professional inbox system that can be easily implemented in any system, for example in business website, portfolio etc.
This project can be adapted internally to any online system.
This system sends and receives messages and is compatible with all email servers as it uses Google (gmail) or others as a server. 

I created this Inbox System using: Python, Django as the backend and HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery as the frontend !
